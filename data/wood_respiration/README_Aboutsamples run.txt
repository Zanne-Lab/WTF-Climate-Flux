Gas Flus analysis

1) DRO Native samples were analyzed as per usual 
2) DRO Drought Pine blocks were also analyzed (unlike other harvests) as we were aware that microbe/enzyme samples were planned from these. 
3) For one Rainforest Rescue sample (Tag #1152) we found in-situ nasute termites so we ran gas fluxes and observed CH4 methane production. We subsequently tried to seperate (proberbly not 100% succesful) the termites from the wood and run them both again seperatly leading to "2021127rescueterm-1152" and "2021127rescuewood-1152" respectively. Seperated termites were collected for determination of mass.
